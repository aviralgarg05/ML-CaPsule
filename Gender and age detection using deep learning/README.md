# Gender and Age Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to detect gender and age from images. It employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification, providing an accurate and efficient way to classify gender and estimate age from facial images. OpenCV is used for image processing tasks.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

## Usage
To use the model for gender and age detection, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your environment:**
   Ensure you have all dependencies installed.

2. **Run the model:**
 
## Dataset
This project uses the [UTKFace dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) which contains a large number of images with labeled gender and age information. The dataset is preprocessed to resize images, normalize pixel values, and split into training and validation sets.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following structure:
- **Input Layer:** Accepts RGB images of shape (200, 200, 3).
- **Convolutional Layers:** Multiple layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction.
- **Max-Pooling Layers:** To reduce spatial dimensions.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** To perform high-level reasoning.
- **Output Layers:** Separate layers for gender (binary classification) and age (regression).

## Training
The training process involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Resize images, normalize pixel values, and split the data into training and validation sets.
2. **Model Training:** Train the CNN model using the training dataset.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjust parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs for optimal performance.

## Results
Summarize the key findings and results of the model's performance, including accuracy, loss metrics, and any visualizations of predictions. Include graphs or charts that show training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.

## Usage of OpenCV
OpenCV is utilized for various image processing tasks such as:
- **Face Detection:** Detecting faces in images using pre-trained models.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Converting images to grayscale, resizing, and normalization.
- **Drawing Bounding Boxes:** Visualizing the detected faces and predictions.

Example code snippet for face detection and preprocessing using OpenCV:
```python
import cv2

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image')

# Convert to grayscale
gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Load the face detection model
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Detect faces
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray_image, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5)

# Draw bounding boxes around detected faces
for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
    cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)

# Display the output
cv2.imshow('Face Detection', image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

## Pre-trained Models
Pre-trained models:
- Gender Detection Model
- Age Detection Model

## Future Work
- **Model Optimization:** Improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
- **Dataset Expansion:** Use larger and more diverse datasets.
- **Real-time Detection:** Implement real-time gender and age detection in video streams.
- **Cross-Domain Validation:** Test the model on different datasets to evaluate its robustness.
